==== 6.9.8-angelica-2.4.0
* Disable NFS.
* Enable FUSE (Required for SSHFS).
* Disable btrfs support.

===== Notes
1. We are disabling NFS due to the fact that it causes constant kernel panics
   when dealing with virtual machines. It also is unencrypted and is inferior to
   SSHFS.
2. We are disabling btrfs support as we have a full bcachefs system.
